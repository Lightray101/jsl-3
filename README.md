# Kanban Task Management Board 🚀

Hey there! 👋 This is my Kanban board project that I built as my JSL project.

## What I Used 🛠️

- **HTML5** - For structuring the webpage
- **CSS3** - For making it look pretty (with some cool features like CSS Grid and Flexbox!)
- **JavaScript** - For making it interactive
- **Google Fonts** - Using "Plus Jakarta Sans" for that modern look
- **Responsive Design** - Works on phones, tablets, and computers!

## What It Does ✨

This is a task management board where you can:
- See your tasks organized in three columns: TODO, DOING, and DONE
- Add up to 6 tasks (3 in the first round, and 3 more if you want)
- Each task has a title, description, and status
- Works on any device size 

## Cool Features I Learned 🎓

- How to use CSS Grid for the column layout
- Making a responsive sidebar that hides on mobile
- Using CSS variables for consistent colors
- Creating a modern, clean UI with shadows and proper spacing
- Handling user input with JavaScript
- Managing task states and filtering

## How to Use It 🎮

1. Open the webpage
2. You can add up to 3 tasks initially
3. Each task needs a title, description, and status
4. If you want, you can add 3 more tasks
5. Your tasks will show up in the appropriate column based on their status

## What I'm Proud Of 🌟

- The clean, modern design
- The responsive layout that works everywhere
- The way I organized the code into sections
- The interactive task management system
